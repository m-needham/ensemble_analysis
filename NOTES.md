Description: 

#### Specific Casenames
The cases in `casenames_subset.txt` were chosen according to the following procedure
* The total, top of atmosphere energy transport was calculated for all 100 members of the ensemble
* The average energy transport at 30$\degree$N was calculated for each ensemble member for the period of 1975-1985
* The 100 ensemble members were sorted by this value
* Each 10th ensemble member was selected, starting with the 5th
> In other words, the 5th, 15th, 25th, ... , 85th, and 95th ensemble members (as sorted by the 1975-1985 average 30$\degree$N energy transport) were chosen for further analysis
* Further analysis was performed on this subset rather than the entire ensemble to reduce the computational load
